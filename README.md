# beanFactory
It's a simple project to test how bean factory could work in order to avoid class constructors with too many parameters, and also can avoid cyclic reference

To run the project is just download it and in the folder 'beanFactory/src/test/java/com/adriano/beanFactory/service' run the test 'testGetServiceInstance' in the class 'ClassRoomTest'
